This is a design for a table in the bleachers.

Notes:
This sounds rediculous. I am aware. However, we had one of these at one point in time, however it was disasembled for 80/20 around 2017/2018.

Intentions:
A:  Have the ability to store the briefcase
B:  Provide a stable location to set laptops upon for scouting/programming.
